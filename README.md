# Pirate Dictionary of Doom

Welcome to the Pirate Dictionary of Doom.  
No mercy, no rules – just ridiculous words, half-assed definitions, and enough rum to drown a kraken.

## What this trash fire does

- Spits out random pirate words for no good reason
- Gives you a definition that barely makes sense
- Insults you every time you click – and you deserve it
- Plays some busted accordion sound that slows down the drunker you get
- The “Sober Up” button shakes like a seasick rat when you're too far gone

## How to use this mess

| Button     | What it does                            |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Previous   | Shows some random crap from earlier      |
| Next       | More nonsense, more insults              |
| Sober Up   | Resets the drunkenness, not your shame   |

## Preview

If you’ve got it deployed somewhere:  
`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

(Replace that, genius)

## Files

- `index.html` – the entire disaster packed into one file
- `README.md` – this fine piece of literature

## Deployment on GitHub Pages

1. Name the HTML file `index.html`, or prepare for a 404 slap to the face.
2. Push it to your repo.
3. Go to the repository settings > Pages:
   - Choose branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`
4. Wait. Drink. Yell at the sea. The site goes live.

## License

Do whatever the hell you want with it. Fork it, steal it, turn it into your own insult machine.  
Just don’t cry when your boss finds it and HR wants a word.
